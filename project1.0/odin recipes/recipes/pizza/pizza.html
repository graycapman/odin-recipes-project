<p><em><h3>Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napoletana, is known for its simple, high-quality ingredients and soft, chewy crust. The dough is made from just flour, water, salt, and yeast, then left to ferment slowly, which gives it its signature light texture and subtle flavor. After rising, the dough is stretched by hand into a thin round with a slightly thicker edge. The traditional toppings include crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella (often mozzarella di bufala), a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a few fresh basil leaves.

Once assembled, the pizza is cooked at a very high temperature—typically in a wood-fired oven reaching about 430/480°C (800900°F). This quick bake, only about 60–90 seconds, creates the iconic leopard-spotted crust: soft and elastic inside with slight charring outside. The result is a fragrant, balanced pizza where the flavors of the fresh ingredients shine without being overshadowed by heavy sauces or toppings.</h3></em></p>
