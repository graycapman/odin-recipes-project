<p><em><h3>To make Enzo’s Spaghetti all’Amatriciana, begin by heating olive oil in a pan and adding diced guanciale, letting it cook slowly until it becomes crispy and golden. The rendered fat is essential for the dish’s rich flavor. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for gentle heat, then pour in crushed tomatoes. Let the sauce simmer so the flavors meld and the guanciale infuses the tomatoes with its savory depth. Season lightly with salt, remembering that the guanciale is naturally salty.

Meanwhile, cook spaghetti in well-salted boiling water until al dente. Transfer the pasta directly into the simmering sauce, bringing a bit of the starchy pasta water with it to help the sauce cling. Toss everything together, then finish with a generous handful of grated Pecorino Romano, stirring until it melts into the sauce. Serve immediately, topping with a little extra cheese and freshly cracked black pepper for the perfect, simple Roman classic.

<h3>ingredients</h3>
<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>12 ounces guanciale (cured pork jowl), sliced and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
<li>1 cup diced onion</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ cup white wine</li>
<li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (such as San Marzano)</li>
<li>1 cup water, divided</li>
<li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
<li>2 (16 ounce) packages spaghetti</li>
<li> 1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
<li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>

<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add guanciale and cook, stirring frequently until slightly browned, about 7 minutes. Remove guanciale to a plate. Leave a bit of the rendered fat in the skillet and discard the rest.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Add onion to the skillet and cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook for 1 minute. Return guanciale to the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in white wine and cook until wine has reduced slightly, about 3 minutes.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Stir in canned tomatoes, breaking up whole tomatoes with a spoon. Pour 1/3 cup water into the tomato can, swirl around to rinse the can, and pour into the skillet with remaining 2/3 cup water and tomato paste. Bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Ladle out about 1/2 cup of the pasta water, add to the sauce in the skillet, and mix well. Drain spaghetti and stir into the sauce until well combined.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Sprinkle generous amounts of Pecorino Romano cheese over each serving, and garnish with basil.</p>
