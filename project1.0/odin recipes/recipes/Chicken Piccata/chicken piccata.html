<p><em><h3>Chicken Piccata is a bright, buttery Italian-American classic that tastes impressive while staying very simple to make. Thin chicken cutlets are dredged lightly in flour, which helps them brown beautifully and gives the sauce a silky texture. When cooked, the combination of lemon juice, broth, and capers creates a tangy, savory sauce that coats the chicken without feeling heavy. It’s the kind of dish that feels fancy even though it comes together fast, making it perfect for a weeknight dinner.
To make it, start by seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, then coat each piece lightly in flour, shaking off the extra. Heat the butter and olive oil in a pan until sizzling and cook the chicken until golden on both sides. Remove the chicken, then add lemon juice, chicken broth, and capers to the same pan, scraping up any browned bits. Let the sauce simmer for a minute or two, then return the chicken and spoon the sauce over it until warmed through. Finish with fresh parsley and serve with pasta, rice, or vegetables.</h3></em></p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<li>2 chicken breasts, sliced into thin cutlets</li>
<li>Salt and black pepper</li>
<li>½ cup flour (for dredging)</li>
<li>3 tbsp butter</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>2–3 tbsp capers (drained)</li>
<li>Fresh parsley (chopped)</li>
<ol>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides. Lightly dredge each piece in flour, shaking off any excess. Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Once the chicken is browned, remove it from the skillet and set it on a plate.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers to the skillet. Stir well, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan to build flavor. Let the mixture simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add a tablespoon of butter to enrich the sauce and stir until melted. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook for an additional 2 minutes, spooning sauce over the top.</p>
<li><strong>step</strong></li>
<p>Allow the sauce to thicken slightly, then turn the heat to low and let everything simmer gently for 1 to 2 minutes so the chicken absorbs the lemon–capers flavor. Remove the chicken once warmed through. Taste the sauce and adjust with more lemon or butter if desired. Pour the sauce over the chicken, sprinkle fresh parsley on top, and serve immediately with pasta, potatoes, or vegetables.</p>
